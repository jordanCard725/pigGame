                <li>The game has 2 players, playing in rounds</li>
                <li>In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he whishes. Each result gets added to his ROUND score</li>
                <li>The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his TOTAL score. After you hold, it's the next player's turn</li>
                <li>BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all of his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn</li>
                <li>If a player rolls two 6's in a row, all of his TOTAL score is lost. Then it's the next player's turn</li>
                <li>The first player to reach a TOTAL score of the predetermiend 'Winning Score', wins the game</li>
